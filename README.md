# Employee Data Analysis

## Overview

This project showcases an analysis of employee salary data stored in the EmpData database. (Note: Data is simulated).

## Methodology

Data was simulated using OpenAI and further edited in Google Sheets, where additional columns were added. After this, the data was exported as an Excel file and then imported into Microsoft SQL Server, where exploratory analysis was performed. This includes basic statistics, data cleaning, and various insights into employee salaries and department expenditures.

## Questions Addressed

- What are the minimum, maximum, average, and range of salaries?
- What is each employee's most recent salary?
- What is the total amount of money each employee has earned during their time at the organization?
- Which department is the highest earning in the organization per year?

## Outcome

The analysis of the companyâ€™s salary data reveals several key insights into workplace dynamics and financial management practices:

- **Salary Distribution:** The data showcases a range of annual salaries from $45,000 to $87,000, with the range being $42,000. The mean salary is $68,000, which is close to the average of the minimum and maximum ($66,000). This suggests a relatively balanced distribution in salary, highlighting the importance of regular salary reviews and equitable pay practices to retain employees and keep them satisfied.
  
- **Departmental Earnings:** The Finance department consistently emerged as the highest earning department in the organization year after year. This might suggest the department's vital role within the organization. However, it also raises questions about periodic budget assessments to ensure that payroll aligns with organizational objectives.

- **Top Performer:** Tracey Lee from the IT department has been identified as a standout employee, being the highest earner overall during her tenure with the company. This emphasizes the value of recognizing and rewarding top performers to retain them.
