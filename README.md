# Employee Data Analysis 
## Overview
This project showcases an analysis on employee salary data stored in the EmpData database. (Note: Data is simulated).

## Methodology
Data was simulated using OpenAI, and further edited in Google Sheets where additional columns were added. After this, the data was exported as an excel file and then imported into Microsoft SQL Server, where exploratory analysis was performed. This includes basic statistics, data cleaning, and other various insights into emppolyee salaries and department expenditures. 

## Questions
What are the Minimum, Maximum, Average, Range of Salaries?

What is Each Employee's most recent salary?

What is the Total Amount of money each employee has earned during their time at the organization?

What department is the highest earning in the organization per year?

## Outcome
The analysis of the companyâ€™s salary data reveals several key insights into workplace dynamic and financial management practices. The data showcases a range of annual salaries from $45,000 to $87,000, the range being $42,000. The mean salary of $68,000, being close to the average of the minimum and maximum, $66,000. This suggests a relatively balanced distribution in salary, noting the importance of regular salary reviews and equitable pay practices to retain employees and keep them satisfied.

It was determined that the Finance department, year after year, was most consistently the highest earning department in the organization. What this might suggest is their role being vital to the organization. On other hand, it can raise questions about periodic budget assessments, making sure that payroll aligns with organizational objectives.

Additionally, Tracey Lee of the IT department has been identified as a standout employee, the highest earner overall during her tenure with this company. This may show the value of recognizing and rewarding those top-performers in order to retain
them.
